# Raydium CP-Swap (CPMM) Bug Bounty Program

Raydium's full bug bounty program with ImmuneFi can be found at: https://immunefi.com/bounty/raydium/

## Rewards by Threat Level

Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. This is a simplified 5-level scale, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.

### Smart Contracts

| Severity | Bounty                    |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Critical | USD 50,000 to USD 505,000 |
| High     | USD 40,000                |
| Medium   | USD 5,000                 |

All bug reports must include a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited to impact an asset-in-scope to be eligible for a reward. Critical and High severity bug reports should also include a suggestion for a fix. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.

Rewards for critical smart contract bug reports will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk if the bug discovered is exploited. However, there is a minimum reward of USD 50,000.

Bugs in `raydium-sdk` and other code outside of the smart contract will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

## Report Submission

Please email security@reactorlabs.io with a detailed description of the attack vector. For high- and critical-severity reports, please include a proof of concept. We will reach back out within 24 hours with additional questions or next steps on the bug bounty.

## Payout Information

Payouts are handled by the Raydium team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts can be done in RAY, SOL, or USDC.

## Out of Scope & Rules

The following vulnerabilities are excluded from the rewards for this bug bounty program:

- Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage
- Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials
- Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist)
- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles (not excluding oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks)
- Basic economic governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)
- Lack of liquidity
- Best practice critiques
- Sybil attacks
- Centralization risks
- Any UI bugs
- Bugs in the core Solana runtime (please submit these to [Solana's bug bounty program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/security/policy))
- Vulnerabilities that require a validator to execute them
- Vulnerabilities requiring access to privileged keys/credentials
- MEV vectors the team is already aware of
